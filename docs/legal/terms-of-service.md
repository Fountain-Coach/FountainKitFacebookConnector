# Terms of Service — Fountain Coach Facebook Connector

Effective date: 2026-01-28

This repository provides a connector library used by Fountain Coach applications to import a user’s own Facebook posts (text + images) for storytelling.

By using a host application that integrates this connector, you agree:

- You will only connect accounts you are authorized to access.
- Imported content is used for your personal storytelling/workflow within the app.
- The integration is self-only and does not support fetching other users’ content.

For questions, open an issue in this repository.
